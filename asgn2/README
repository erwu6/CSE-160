This is my assignment 2 for CSE 160.

I utilized the following resources to complete this assignment:

- Resources listed in the assignment
- ChatGPT to help with the syntax of the code (on line 150 in BlockyAnimal.js)
- Work from previous assignments and YouTube videos given on this assignment
- Lab Activity: Performance to view the FPS
- Google's AI overview to explain concepts such as "keydown" and event.key to record what keys are being pressed
