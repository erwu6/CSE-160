This is my assignment 3 for CSE 160.

I utilized the following resources to complete this assignment:

- Resources listed in the assignment
- ChatGPT to help with the understanding the code (for example, how to get the correct UV coordinates in renderFast()) & to help debug issues with the code such as in raining function and Cube.js
- Work from previous assignments and YouTube videos given on this assignment
- Google's AI overview to explain concepts such as "keydown" and event.key to record what keys are being pressed
