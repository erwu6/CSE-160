This is my second assignment for CSE 160.

I utilized the following resources to complete this assignment:

- Resources listed in the assignment
- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html/how-to-show-images-on-click-using-html/
- ChatGPT to help with the syntax of the code (on line 546 in asg1.js)
- Google's AI overview to explain concepts such as "keydown" and event.key to record what keys are being pressed
